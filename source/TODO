Time has been real tight which has resulted on puddletag being neglected.
Improve the console version cause it's kinda sucky.
User interface improvements that I have in mind are:
    Enabling drag and drop in the dirview.
    Allow the user  to add toolbar buttons corresponding to an action.
    Enable Action editing(maybe with KDE)

    Expect more powerful scripting for the next release, I'll be working on the
    console version which I'll include in the release if it's good enough.

    The library code is currently in first-draft mode. i.e I still have a bunch
    of stuff to add and some cleanup to do.

    The next release won't be a 'feature' release so to speak as I'm going to be
    concentrating on fixing bugs and porting any remaining functions that
    Mp3tag has over to puddletag.

    I've been toying with the idea of a console version (Maybe for the next release,
    but probably not).

    Oh, and I really gotta make puddletag look a bit prettier and improve some
    minor niggles.

    Yeah, I gotta speed it up too. Currently puddletag lags behind Mp3tag in
    the speed category.
