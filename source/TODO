The only big things I can think about are:
Rhythmbox and mpd library support.
Library stuff, like finding duplicates, maybe some stats (I hate that
most programs don't provide good lib stats)
Automatic tagging. Like trying one tag source after another if no
matches are found.
Loading only files matching pattern.
The filesystem browser needs some updating. It needs to update the
directory tree if it's changed. And keyboard-surfing should work too.
A better console version. It shouldn't do much besides editing tags,
running functions/actions.
Integrating the logging thing with the whole app and having logs for
most everything.
Massive, massive code cleanup.
Docs for everything that needs it like plugins and all the new stuff.
Drag and drop album art (this seems like it'll be a cinch to implement).
Alternating colours by album instead of row.
Changing the search box so that each tag source can handle searches
in it's specific way. Which means that you'll be able to do things
like search a specific album page for allmusic or retrieve a specific
album by musicbrainz id.
