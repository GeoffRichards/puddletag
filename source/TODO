    The library code is currently in first-draft mode. i.e I still have a bunch
    of stuff to add and some cleanup to do.

    The next release won't be a 'feature' release so to speak as I'm going to be
    concentrating on fixing bugs and porting any remaining functions that
    Mp3tag has over to puddletag.

    I've been toying with the idea of a console version (Maybe for the next release,
    but probably not).

    Oh, and I really gotta make puddletag look a bit prettier and improve some
    minor niggles.

    Yeah, I gotta speed it up too. Currently puddletag lags behind Mp3tag in
    the speed category.
