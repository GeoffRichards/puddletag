puddletag is my first 'real' project and as such I'm pretty sure my code is real shitty.

Currently puddletag is in a bit of a transition state so quite a bit of the new code is slightly shittier than the rest.

However, if you feel like hacking on the code, mail me at cpuddle@users.sourceforge.net and I'll help you out.
