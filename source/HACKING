Some things people have said about the puddletag code:

'Holy sh**' - some atheist after viewing the library code.

'Can somebody blind me, cause I don't think I'll be able to forget what I just saw if I still have sight.' - An experienced coder after opening a random puddletag source file.

'This thing runs?' - Some guy.

'Suddenly, I'm in the mood for spaghetti.' - Some guy's buddy after checking to see what his buddy was exclaiming about.

Feel free to knock out an email to concentricpuddle@gmail.com if you want to contribute or say anything about the code. (Give me at least a week to reply though, I don't check my email every day.)
