puddletag is my first 'real' project and as such I'm pretty sure my code is real shitty.

However, if you feel brave enough to wade through it, you'll find most of the code in the puddlestuff/puddletag.py and puddlestuff/puddleobjects.py. There are docstrings everywhere(though they may suck too) if you need them.

You can contact me at cpuddle@users.sourceforge.net
