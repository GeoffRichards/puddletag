One module to encapsulate all.
Uses dictionary as to get tags. and returns the track as tuple.
Image as a reference or some shit like that.
all tags supported should be supported with the ability to create new ones as in mp3tag.

Gui, much like mp3tag.

Parser should be redesigned, what I have is shitty.
Current way of separating the functions is working well, but need to implement something that takes care of the special characters.
