9 September 2009 (0.7.8)
    New Features:
        A duplicates finder, which is super useful. It's not as well tested as I'd like so I'll make that a priority for the next release.
        Rudimentary file-editing support had been added to the filesystem view.
        Bugs were fixed where needed (I seriously need to remember to log this stuff)
        Note that I haven't added any progress bars for these features (due in a week) so just have patience when using them (and keep an eye on the command line for errors).
    Changes:
        I've changed the config system to use ConfigObj as PyQt4's too buggy and Python's built in library too sucky.
   
    The website looks a lot better.

4 June 2009 (0.7.0)
    New Features:
        Loading times are improved by a couple of miliseconds.
        Showing duplicates can now be slightly fuzzy by adding : in front of the tag that's to be used.
        Added an :artist fuzzy compare listing to the libary view.
    Fixes:
        Sorting or doing anything else while some rows are higlighted is fixed.
        Other little stuff that I can't remember.
    Changes:
        The user interface has been modified just a tad, to be me 'aligned.'

1 May 2009 (0.6.5)
    New Features:
        Cut, copy,  paste.
        All Functions now have a saved history.
        The current selection is now preserved when sorting.
        Saving and loading is a lot faster. On par with Mp3tag.

    Changes:
        Because, of the cut, copy, paste actions being added. All window menus, were move to a new Windows Menu.
        A progress indicator is shown when loading a music library.
        An error message is shown (on the console) if a file failed to load.
        puddletag settings are now stored in ~/.puddletag

    Fixes:
        Saving or changing the image type now works in both the tag editor and Extended tags dialog.
        Also, the image controls being enabled or disabled depending on the file now works properly.
        Clicking Cancel while loading or saving works instantly.

11 April 2009 (0.6.0)
    Bugs wrt to tagging were fixed, like:
        Saving pictures on an mp3 file with the same description.
        No more 'copy method' doesn't exist errors.
        Flickering of the >> and << buttons belowe images were removed.
        Buttons on the image editor are enabled or disabled depending on file.

10 April 2009 (0.5.9)
    Mp4 support was added (Mutagen > 1.9 is needed and Mutagen <= 1.9 isn't supported anymore.)
    Bugs wrt FLAC are sorted.
    And a console version was added. At the moment it's pretty basic, but as time goes on, it'll become better.

23 March 2009 (0.5.4)
    More bugfixes, especially related with the library treeview.
    The In Library and Show Dupes action now change the colors of the rows that match instead of hiding those that don't.
    The Rename Dir action now works with library files. Keep in mind though that it only works for files loaded in the file-view and any other files that happen to reside in the same directory will not be updated.

10 March 2009 (0.5.3)
    A couple of bugfixes.
        Actions sometimes behaved unexpectedly in that they didn't take the currently edited values into account.
        The show dupes button now works.
        A search was added button to the library window, so that slow searches(like prokyon) don't suck as much.
        A bug where strings such as '%artist% - %title%.lower(%__ext%) didn't work as expected, because the last part wasn't matched properly.

8 March 2009
    Nope, still don't got no console version(next release, definitely).

    Anyway, some changes from the last release include:
        The abilitiy to search the music libraries(Albeit slowly).
        A totally revamped parsing system(though it'll look the same from the users point of view).
        Like Mp3tag, Actions are now stored separately instead of in one big file.
	Two extra toolbar buttons, "In library" and 'Show Dupes".
	If a library is loaded then "In library?" hides all the files that are not in the library.
	"Show Dupes" hides all the files in the file-view that doesn't have a duplicate(in the file-view).

    For the next release I'll concentrate on supporting the rest of Mutagen's supported formats, fixing bugs and smoothing the user interface(progress when loading a library, faster search, etc.).

    Expect some interim updates over the next couple of days and a complete release in about a month(1 April 2009).

5 February 2009
    This is basically a bugfix release.

    The were far too many to list here, but some of the major ones were unicode related like:
        Unicode support in prokyon, amarok and rhythmbox libraries was fixed.
        UTF-8 is used for everything.
        puddletag's unicode issues were sorted(e.g. If the last folder you visited
        contained non-ascii characters, puddletag would give you a big F-U.
        Changing a picture using the extended tags dialog now works.

    Some other interesting stuff include:
        The user interface has changed. This includes the look of the icons have improved (they're still shitty, but still)
        If you wanna, you can use the __image tag to show the currently selected file's cover in the Tag Editor (Go to Preferences -> Tag Editor to add it)

    Hmmm, most of the other changes have to do with code quality and refactoring, which I doubt you'll wanna hear.

    The only thing I have for the next release is more powerful scripting and (maybe not, but probably) a console version.

20 January 2009
    Added Music library support for Amarok, Prokyon and Rhythmbox.
    Currently, it's kinda sucky, but I'll spend some time on it and fix
    it as best I can.

    The extended tags dialog now support editing and saving images.
    It also acts a bit more like Mp3tag's with options to move to the
    next and previous file in the file-view.

    The tag editor and filesystem editors have been converted to tool windows
    to allow more interface customization.

    Multiple tags are now available. I've followed Mp3tag's style of allowing
    the user to create multiple tags by using '\\' in the tag editor and
    removing multiple tags if the tag was edited in the file view.

    Nasty bug that deleted any tags not recognized by puddletag was removed.

    Any bugs to do with the extended tags dialog has been fixed(I hope)

    I modified much of the loading and saving code to be independent of
    PyQt so that users using PyQt 4.4.3 don't get those save and loading errors
    anymore.

    ...Can't remember what else I did, cause I forgot to update the log.

3 December 2008
    Interface stuff:
        The musicbrainz dialog doesn't freeze anymore.
        Added a splash screen for the long loading times at the beginning.
        Genres are now available too

2 December 2008
    Just two things
    Added shortcuts -> Just press Ctrl+W to switch between the file-view, pattern combo and tag combos.
    Fixed niggling things like some controls not having accelerators.
