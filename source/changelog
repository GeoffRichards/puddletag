    Man page added.
    New logo created.
    Added data files to source tarball.
    Added documentation to source tarball.

New Features:
    Much improved masstagging.
    Save artwork to file Function.
    Filter that behaves like Mp3tag's.
    In Discogs tag source:
            Added the ability to retrieve track artists
            for Various Artist albums.

            This required that the involvedpeople field be renamed
            to involvedpeople_album as a list of involved people were
            returned for each track too.

            These people are added to the involvedpeople_track field.

    URL links for albums in Tag Sources dialog are shown for all
    Tag Sources (except FreeDB).
    
    Tag to filename and Tag->Dir functions handle patterns
    like '../%artist%' and './%artist%/%album%' correctly.

    Options for setting the pattern used in saving covers to file dialogs.
    Ability to drag and drop folders on file-view.

Fixes:
    Lines that contain '/' being parsed incorrectly in Import Text File dialog.
    FreeDB tag source artist/album parsing.
    Undoing renaming of dirs.
    MusicBrainz Tag Source ratings error.
    Tag->Dir creating subfolders when it shouldn't.
    Issue 132: Images weren't being added to list of fields to undo.
    
    Numbering of COMM frames (and others like it) to have frames with
    the same description being number 0,1,2,3 instead of 0,01,002, etc.
    
    When editing actions, if a field not in the current list of fields was
    used, then the list of saved fields would contain only that field.
    
    If a file contained an ID3v2.2 tag than that tag would be shown
    twice in the Stored Tags window.
    
    Patterns that use scripting functions like $validate(arg1,,arg3) will
    work correctly in that the second argument will evaluate to an empty
    string instead of being discarded.

    For Discogs Tag Source: Images were being retrieved even if disabled
    when using textual searches.

    Changing files in Extended Tags changes the selection in File-View,
    thereby ensuring changes are written to the correct file.

    Editing colour in Extended Tags remaining green even if changed.
    Multiple value handling for ID3v2.3

    Images can be removed when the Cover Varies in Extended Tags.
    The semi-colon character(';') has been removed from the list of
    invalid filename chars.
    
    Renaming dirs hooks into Tag->Dir function now.
    lyrics_us is now unsyncedlyrics

    Proper error messages differentiating whether the error occurred.
    while writing to files or renaming dirs, files.
    
    Subfolder checkbox in the Filesystem window being enabled
    when it had no reason to be.
    
    If last loaded dir is not found on startup,
    then all parents of that dir (still existing) will be expanded.

        All fields are caseless.
        Fixed the loading of fields with numbers for values.
