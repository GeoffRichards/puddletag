Paul McGuire for PyParsing and helping me out on the discussion board.
Michael Urman and Joe Wreschnig for Mutagen (Another cool library).
Phil Thomson and the Qt and PyQt people for PyQt4.

And for the people whose code I stole:
The guy on ActiveState who wrote the unique(gets all unique elements from a list) recipe.
The other one who wrote the case-insensitive sort.
Those who helped me out on comp.lang.python

Lastly, to everyone working on open source and especially for the cool programs. Thanks.
