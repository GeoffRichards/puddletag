Thanks to

Paul McGuire for PyParsing (It's really good once you get past the documentation) and helping me on the discussion board.
Michael Urman and Joe Wreschnig for Mutagen (Another cool library).
Phil Thomson and the Qt people for PyQt4.

And for the code I stole:
The guy on ActiveState who wrote the unique(gets all unique elements from a list) recipe.
The other one who wrote the case-insensitive sort.
Those who help me on comp.lang.python

Everyone working on Debian. You're all going to heaven.
