Let me try to imitate you for a bit. You may be thinking:

What is puddletag?
	And I'll reply that puddletag is a tag editor for Linux based loosely on the windows program Mp3tag. Basically it uses a table layout so that all the tags you want to edit by hand are visible and easily editable. Besides that, puddletag also allows you to extract tags from filenames and renaming files based on their tags by using patterns(that you define, not crappy, uneditable ones).

Why puddletag?
	Mp3tag was the only reason I kept an XP partition around.

What makes it different?
	Currently, nothing. Except that the layout differs considerably from Mp3tag. Unlike Mp3tag though, puddletag sucks. This will be addressed in future.

	If you're interested, puddletag was written in Python2.4 on Debian Etch. It uses PyQt4 for the GUI and PyParsing for the parsing stuff and Mutagen as the tagging library. All are available via apt on Debian and Kubuntu as python-qt4, python-pyparsing and python-mutagen respectively. I haven't tested on other distributions, but it should work (holler at your pets if it doesn't).

	Most important of all, puddletag is released under GPLv2.

How do I get it?
	Follow the links at http://puddletag.sourceforge.net or alternatively, using svn
	svn co https://puddletag.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/puddletag puddletag

And run it?
	In the main puddletag directory, you'll find a file called puddletag.py. You can run it by typing python puddletag.py in your console.

Releases?
	Swing by the website (http://puddletag.sourceforge.net) every couple of weeks (next release due, 1 June 2009) for updates.

Questions?
    There's a puddletag reddit over on http://www.reddit.com/r/puddletag if you have any questions. Alternatively, send me a mail at concentricpuddle@gmail.com.
