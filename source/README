puddletag is a tag editor for LInux loosely based on the awesome Windows program Mptag. It does basic tag editing like any other tag editing like any other tag editor out there, but with a table based layout that allows you too see and edit many tags at once. Things like renaming files using its tag and retrieving tags via a filename is made easy.

Supported formats are: id3v1 and id3v2 (.mp3), APEv2 (.ape), AAC (.m4a, .mp4), VorbisComments (.flac, .ogg) though album art is supported for FLAC files only.

But there's more...
There's functions, which can do things like replace text, trim, change the case of any tag, etc. Actions can automate repetitive tasks, and then theres importing music libraries (though only QuodLibet is supported for now), automatic retrieval of tags via musicbrainz and more, so fire it up and explore.

Requirements
	At least Python2.5.
	PyQt4 (python-pyqt4 for most Linux distributions) for the GUI (puddletag was developed with PyQt4.5 though it may work with previous versions)
	PyParsing (python-parsing in some distros, python-pyparsing in others) is used for parsing.
	Mutagen (python-mutagen) takes care of reading/writing tags.
	ConfigObj (python-configobj in most distros) is used to read/write settings.
	python-musicbrainz2 for musicbrainz support.

	In order to use the QuodLibet library you need QuodLIbet installed.
	And to edit/view FLAC album art the Python Imaging Library (usually python-pil or python-image as a distro package) is required.

License:
	GPLv2, which you can find at www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html

Where to get it.
	There's a download link it at http://puddletag.sourceforge.net or alternatively, using svn
	svn co https://puddletag.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/puddletag puddletag

How to run it.
	Unzip the tarball and cd into the puddletag directory. In it you can run the puddletag executable using ./puddletag. Although it will install (using setup.py) this is not recommended as the results may not be satisfactory.

Release schedule.
	I don't adhere to a strict release schedule so releases are released when they are released. In the past this has been about once a month. Swing by the puddletag website http://puddletag.sourceforge.net for updates.
