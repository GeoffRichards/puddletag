Let me try to imitate you for a bit. You may be thinking:

What is puddletag?
	And I'll reply that puddletag is a tag editor for Linux based loosely on the windows program Mp3tag. Basically it uses a table layout so that all the t ags you want to edit by hand are visible and easily editable. Besides that, puddletag also allows you to extract tags from filenames and renaming files based on their tags by using patterns(that you define, not crappy, uneditable ones).

Why puddletag?
	Mp3tag was the only reason I kept an XP partition around.

What makes it different?
	Besides being more buggy that Mp3tag (to be addressed), puddletag can import Rhythmbox and Prokyon music libraries, allowing for a better tag editing experience than the programs provide (including being able to search for duplicates). To see the rest you'll have to try out puddletag

What you need.
	At least Python2.5. 
	PyQt4 for the GUI 
	PyParsing is used for parsing. 
	Mutagen does the tagging. 

	For music library support you'll need:
		Python-MySQLdb for Prokyon3
		python-Levenshtein for string comparison functions (these are written in C and are fast)

	Also note python-musicbrainsz2 for MusicBrainz support is recommended.

	GPLv2, which you can find at www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html

How do I get it?
	There's a download link it at http://puddletag.sourceforge.net or alternatively, using svn
	svn co https://puddletag.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/puddletag puddletag

And run it?
	In the main puddletag directory, you'll find a file called puddletag.py. You can run it by typing python puddletag.py in your console.

Releases?
	Swing by the website (http://puddletag.sourceforge.net) every couple of weeks (next release due, 5 October 2009) for updates.

Questions?
    There's a puddletag reddit over on http://www.reddit.com/r/puddletag if you have any questions. Alternatively, send me a mail at concentricpuddle@gmail.com.
