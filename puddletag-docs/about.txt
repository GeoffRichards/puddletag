About puddletag
---------------

puddletag is just a tag editor. Although it's likely better than what you're used to (unless you've used Mp3tag, in which case it's kinda like what you're used to).

About the author

You may call me concentricpuddle, but I also go by Keith. I'm contactable via email (concentricpuddle@gmail.com), but only if you want to discuss something completely outside the scope of the `forum <http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/puddletag>`_.

Thank yous

First off, a big thanks to **Evan Devetzis** for working tirelessly in helping me make puddletag better by contributing many, many awesome ideas and for being a great bug hunter.

Thanks to **RaphaÃ«l Rochet** and **Fabian Bakkum** for contributing translations.

To the writers of the libraries puddletag depends on (without which I'll probably still be writing an id3 reader).

+ **Paul McGuire** for PyParsing and for being extraordinarily helpful.
+ **Michael Urman** and **Joe Wreschnig** for Mutagen (It. Is. Awesome).
+ **Nokia, Phil Thomson** and all parties responsible for PyQt4.
+ **Michael Foord** and **Nicola Larosa** for ConfigObj (seriously, they should replace ConfigParser with this).
+ The **Oxygen team** for the Oxygen icons.

And for those who've contributed, the people whose code I stole, those who helped me out on discussion boards and to open-source creators, **Thanks a bunch**.
