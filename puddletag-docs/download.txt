Dependencies
------------

puddletag requires the following dependencies. Visit the respective project's page if you having trouble installing a component.

Install instructions follow below.

+   At least `Python 2.6 (but not Python 3) <http://python.org>`_
+   `PyQt4 (with Qt of course) (4.5 or greater) <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro>`_ for the GUI.
+   `PyParsing (≥1.5.1) <http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com>`_ takes care of the parsing...
+   `Mutagen (1.20 recommended, 1.14 required) <http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/>`_ is used as the tagging lib and...
+   `Chromaprint (≥ 0.4) <http://acoustid.org/chromaprint>`_ (optional) for AcoustID support.

.. _installing_from_source:

Installing from source
----------------------

Install the dependencies as listed above. For Debian-based distros, you can run the following as root:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get install python-qt4 python-pyparsing python-mutagen

+ Now download the source tarball |source_link|_ (SHA1 |source_sha|).
+ Unzip it.
+ You can run puddletag from that directory by typing ``./puddletag`` from the unzipped directory in your console.
+ Alternatively install it by running ``python setup.py install`` as root in the unzipped directory.
+ puddletag should appear in your Multimedia (or Sounds etc.) menu. If not run ``desktop-file-install puddletag.desktop`` as root in the unzipped directory.

.. note:: For AcoustID support in Ubuntu you will also need to **fpcalc** binary
    For Ubuntu 12.04 and later it is available in the libchromaprint-tools 
    package.

    For earlier versions and other distros please visit the 
    `AcoustID <http://acoustid.org/chromaprint>`_ page for installation
    instructions.

.. _installing_from_the_debian_package:

.. _installing_on_ubuntu:


Installing on Ubuntu
--------------------

You can install puddletag from the Software Centre in recent versions of Ubuntu.

A Debian package is no longer provided, because of the complexity of generating a deb for different Ubuntu versions.

If you prefer using the latest version, `WebUpd8 <http://www.webupd8.org/>`_ provide puddletag packages in their `PPA <https://launchpad.net/~nilarimogard/+archive/ubuntu/webupd8>`_.


.. _installing_on_fedora_14_and_later:

Installing on Fedora 14 and later
---------------------------------

Just run (as root):

.. code-block:: bash

   yum install puddletag

Sometimes the latest version is still in the testing repo. Then you should use (also as root:)

.. code-block:: bash

   yum --enablerepo=updates-testing install


.. _installing_on_osx:

Installing on OSX
-----------------

.. note:: The below section is outdated as Homebrew doesn't support PyQt4 anymore and the Vortexbox links are broken.
          If you have further instructions on how to fix these, add an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/keithgg/puddletag/issues>`_.


Homebrew
^^^^^^^^

- Install the package manager from http://brew.sh.
- Download and install puddletag by typing "brew install puddletag" in your console

From source
^^^^^^^^^^^

There's a `great article on the VortexBox wiki <http://info.vortexbox.org/tiki-index.php?page=puddletag+on+os+x>`_ detailing the steps you need to follow. 

You can also use Fink as `reported by wgscott on the forum <http://puddletag.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=258>`_.

.. _development_builds:

Development builds
------------------

Source control is done using Git. Use

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:keithgg/puddletag.git

to check it out. And

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull origin master

in the previously cloned directory to update it a later stage.
