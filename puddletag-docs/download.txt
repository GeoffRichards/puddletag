Dependencies
------------

puddletag requires the following dependencies. Visit the respective project's page if you having trouble installing a component.

Install instructions follow below.

+   At least `Python 2.6 (but not Python 3) <http://python.org>`_
+   `PyQt4 (with Qt of course) (4.5 or greater) <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro>`_ for the GUI.
+   `PyParsing (≥1.5.1) <http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com>`_ takes care of the parsing...
+   `Mutagen (1.20 recommended, 1.14 required) <http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/>`_ is used as the tagging lib and...
+   `ConfigObj (≥ 4.5.0) <http://voidspace.org.ux/python/configobj.html>`_ takes care of saving settings.
+   `Chromaprint (≥ 0.4) <http://acoustid.org/chromaprint>`_ (optional) for AcoustID support.

.. _installing_from_source:

Installing from source
----------------------

Install the dependencies as listed above. For Debian-based distros, you can run the following as root:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get install python-qt4 python-pyparsing python-mutagen python-configobj

+ Now download the source tarball |source_link|_ (SHA1 |source_sha|).
+ Unzip it.
+ You can run puddletag from that directory by typing ``./puddletag`` from the unzipped directory in your console.
+ Alternatively install it by running ``python setup.py install`` as root in the unzipped directory.
+ puddletag should appear in your Multimedia (or Sounds etc.) menu. If not run ``desktop-file-install puddletag.desktop`` as root in the unzipped directory.

.. note:: For AcoustID support in Ubuntu you will also need to **fpcalc** binary
    For Ubuntu 12.04 and later it is available in the libchromaprint-tools 
    package.

    For earlier versions and other distros please visit the 
    `AcoustID <http://acoustid.org/chromaprint>`_ page for installation
    instructions.

.. _installing_from_the_debian_package:

Installing from the Debian package
----------------------------------

Download the deb, |deb_link|_ (SHA1 |deb_sha|) and install by double clicking it.

If that doesn't work, first install the dependencies by running as root:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get install python-qt4 python-pyparsing python-mutagen python-configobj

Then (also as root)

.. parsed-literal::

    dpkg -i |deb_name|

puddletag should be available from your Multimedia menu.

.. _installing_on_fedora_14_and_later:

Installing on Fedora 14 and later
---------------------------------

Just run (as root):

.. code-block:: bash

   yum install puddletag

Sometimes the latest version is still in the testing repo. Then you should use (also as root:)

.. code-block:: bash

   yum --enablerepo=updates-testing install


.. _installing_on_osx:

Installing on OSX
-----------------

There's a `great article on the VortexBox wiki <http://info.vortexbox.org/tiki-index.php?page=puddletag+on+os+x>`_ detailing the steps you need to follow. 

You can also use Fink as `reported by wgscott on the forum <http://puddletag.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=258>`_.

.. _development_builds:

Development builds
------------------

Source control is done using Git. Use

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:keithgg/puddletag.git

to check it out. And

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull origin master

in the previously cloned directory to update it a later stage.

Translations
------------

To install, place the downloaded translation in **~/.puddletag/translations** (you'll probably need to create it). The translation will be listed in the Preferences dialog. Some if these are incomplete, so if if you'd like contribute a translation, see :doc:`source/translate`.
