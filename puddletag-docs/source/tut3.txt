Things you should know
======================

Adding Album Art
----------------

The first thing you're probably gonna want to do that isn't obvious is add album art.

Show the **Album Art** window by using **Windows->Artwork** menu. Artwork isn't shown by default, because I can't get that dam window to resize correctly. Anyway your layout should look something like this (I've loaded a folder in the mean time). There's more editing album art below.

.. image:: images/tut3_window.png
   :align: center
   :width: 640px
   :height: 466px
   :alt: puddletag with artwork window shown and folder loaded.
   :target: ../_images/tut3_window.png

The File-View
-------------
It lists the the metadata for the fields you've selected to display.

+ Multiple-valued fields are shown like **value1\\\\value2**. Enter a value like that and puddletag will assume you want some multiple values.
+ Right Click on it to get the context menu. Menu items are just as described in :doc:`menus`.
+ When you press Enter after editing a cell, puddletag opens the one just be below it for editing. Shift+Enter will open the one directly above, Tab the one to the right and Shift+Tab the one on the left.

The Pattern Combo
-----------------

+ Pressing F8 switches focus between it and the file-view.
+ Patterns aren't saved by default. Just press Enter and whatever's currently there will be added to the list. **Edit->Preferences->Tag Panel** works as a more fully featured editor.

Tag Panel
---------
+   Like in the file-view multiple values are shown like **value1\\\\value2**. Entering any value like that will automatically split it.
+   Use accelerators like your life depends on them. Pressing Alt+B will switch the focus to the Album field. I usually just switch to the first (Artist) and TAB through everything. See the :ref:`Tag Panel <tag_panel_prefs>` section on the preferences page for info in creating them.

Artwork
-------

Covers you modify aren't saved automatically. You still need to use **Save** from the **File** menu.

+ Right click on the picture container to get a menu. With it you can add/remove/edit artwork.
+ For ID3, be sure to always add descriptions for your Covers in the text box just below.
+ Choose a cover type by clicking the button next to the description box.
+ Click on the cover to see it full-sized. Clicking on the newly-opened window will close it.
+ Cycle through the artwork by using the **Up** and **Down** buttons next to the picture. If the picture should **<blank>** artwork will be removed upon saving. **<keep>** will leave artwork unmodified for each file.


Filesystem
----------
+ Click on a folder to open it.
+ You can select more than one folder at a time.
+ Right click on any folder to get a Context Menu. The menu items are pretty self-explanatory.

Functions
---------

.. image:: tut1/formataction.png
   :align: center
   :alt: puddletag functions
   :target: ../_images/formataction.png

In the **Fields** list:

+   Having **__selected** as the field will apply the selected function to the selected cells. So if you have the album field selected in one file and artist in another. The function'll be applied to the album field of the first file and artist of the other respectively.
+   **__all** will write to all the fields found in a file except filename related fields like __dirname, __filename, etc.
+   You can enter your own fields like **albumartist** or **performersort**.
+   Multiple fields can be written to at a time by separating them by commas like **artist, album, title**, or even **albumartist, __selected**.
+   If you want to write to all fields but the ones you specify use '~'. Eg. **~artist, title, year** will write to all but the artist, title and year fields. **~__selected** will write to all, but the selected.
+   You can put '~' anywhere you want (as long as it's at the start of a field name) like **artist, title, album, ~__selected**. One use case is if for when you want to do Case Conversion to all but the a few fields like **musicip_puid** and **fingerprint** that should remain unchanged. **__all, ~musicip_puid, fingerprint** does as suggested.

Actions
-------
I recommend you assign shortcuts to your favourite actions like Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2 etc. Use the Assign Shortcut button on the Actions Dialog.
